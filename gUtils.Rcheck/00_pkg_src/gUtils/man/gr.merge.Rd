\title{merge GRanges using coordinates as primary key}
\usage{
gr.merge(query, subject, by = NULL, all = FALSE, all.query = all,
  all.subject = all, verbose = FALSE, ignore.strand = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{query ranges}

\item{subject}{subject}

\item{by}{additional metadata fields to join on}

\item{all}{whether to include left and right joins}

\item{all.query}{whether to do a left join}

\item{all.subject}{whether to do a right join}
}
\description{
Uses gr.findoverlaps to enable internal and external joins of GRanges using
syntax similar to "merge" where merging is done using coordinates +/- "by" fields

Uses gr.findoverlaps / findOverlaps for heavy lifting, but returns outputs with
metadata populated as well as query and subject ids.  For external joins,
overlaps x with gaps(y) and gaps(x) with y.
