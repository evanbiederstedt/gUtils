\title{Calc pairwise distance for rearrangements represented by \code{GRangesList} objects}
\usage{
gr.simplify(gr, field = NULL, val = NULL, include.val = TRUE,
  split = FALSE, pad = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{takes in gr or grl}

\item{field}{character scalar, corresponding to value field of gr. \code{[NULL]}}

\item{val}{\code{[NULL]}}

\item{include.val}{scalar logical, will include in out gr values field of first matching record in input gr. \code{[TRUE]}}

\item{split}{Split the output into \code{GRangesList} split by \code{"field"}. \code{[FALSE]}}

\item{pad}{Pad ranges by this amount before doing merge. [1], which merges contiguous but non-overlapping ranges.}
}
\value{
Simplified GRanges with "field" populated with uniquely contiguous values
}
\description{
Simplify granges by collapsing all non-overlapping adjacent ranges that share a given "field" value
(adjacent == adjacent in the input GRanges object)
}
